# Day 2: Single-line and Multi-line Comments
# -----------------------------------

# This is a single-line comment
# It explains what the next line of code does

print("Hello, Python Learner!")  # This prints a greeting message

# You can also place comments at the end of a line
x = 10  # Assigning 10 to variable x
y = 5   # Assigning 5 to variable y

# Performing addition of x and y
sum = x + y
print("Sum:", sum)  # Displaying the result
